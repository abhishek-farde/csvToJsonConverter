I have implemented the CSV to JSON converter script in converter.js file using the method of recursion as complex properties are present which consists of n number of subproperties. To handle that, I am generating the JSON object using recursive approach.

How to use converter.js --->

    1) Save the input CSV file with the name of inputFile.csv (in same folder as of converter.js)
    2) Run converter.js file using the command node converter.js
    3) CSV file will get converted to JSON and will be stored in outputFile.txt in text format
    4) To view the outputFile.txt in JSON object format, we can use any online JSON viewer

Thank you so much!!
